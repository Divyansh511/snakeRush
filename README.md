# snakeRush
Developed Snake Rush, a web-based game using HTML5, CSS3, and
JavaScript to implement a classic Snake game with responsive design and real-time scoring. The game
features dynamic difficulty levels, smooth CSS animations, and interactive user interface (UI) elements.
Utilized DOM manipulation to handle snake movement and event handling to process user input for a
seamless gaming experience.
